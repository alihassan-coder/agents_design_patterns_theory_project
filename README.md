# Agents Design Patterns Theory Project

This repository is a structured collection of **AI Agent Design Patterns**, focusing on both **theory and implementation**.  
It demonstrates how different design approaches can be applied to build scalable, reliable, and intelligent agent-based systems.  

## Definition
**Agent Design Patterns** are reusable solutions and strategies for structuring intelligent agents.  
They help in solving recurring challenges such as task delegation, decision-making, routing, safety, and collaboration.

---

## Why This Project
- To provide a clear understanding of how agents are structured.  
- To bridge the gap between **theory** and **practical coding**.  
- To showcase professional skills in **AI agent development** to companies.  
- To create a reusable reference for future agent-based projects.  

---

## Use Cases
- Workflow automation with multiple agents.  
- Customer support and query routing.  
- Decision-making using LLMs with human-like judgment.  
- Safe execution of tasks with built-in guardrails.  
- Parallel task processing to improve efficiency.  
- Research and learning resource for AI developers.

## Patterns Covered

# Deterministic Handoffs

## 1. Definition
A **Deterministic Handoff** is a structured and predictable way of transferring tasks or control between agents.  
Unlike probabilistic or random routing, deterministic handoffs follow **clear rules and conditions**, ensuring that every request is handled **consistently and reliably**.  

Think of it as an **assembly line**: each agent knows exactly when to step in, what to do, and when to hand the task forward.

---

## 2. Why It Matters
- **Reliability**: Guarantees that tasks always follow the same predictable path.  
- **Traceability**: Makes workflows easier to monitor and debug.  
- **Scalability**: Supports the addition of specialized agents without breaking the chain.  
- **Error Reduction**: Prevents random misrouting of tasks.  
- **Compliance**: Useful in industries where strict rules must be followed (e.g., finance, healthcare).  

---

## 3. Core Principles
1. **Clear Entry & Exit Rules** – each agent knows when to start and when to stop.  
2. **Defined Responsibility** – no overlap or confusion between agents’ roles.  
3. **Sequential Consistency** – tasks move forward in a logical and ordered flow.

## 4. Detailed Flow Example

**Scenario: Customer Billing Request**

- **Agent A: Data Collector**  
  - Collects user details (name, email, invoice number).  
  - Passes the information only if it meets the required format.  

- **Agent B: Verifier**  
  - Validates the data (checks invoice exists, ensures payment method is valid).  
  - If verification fails → sends back to Agent A for correction.  
  - If valid → forwards to Agent C.  

- **Agent C: Executor**  
  - Processes the billing request (e.g., charge card, send invoice).  
  - Marks the process as complete.  

This ensures a **deterministic, predictable chain of responsibility**.

---

## 5. Real-World Use Cases
- **Customer Support**: Chatbot → Support Agent → Billing Department.  
- **Healthcare**: Patient Intake → Verification → Doctor Assignment.  
- **E-commerce**: Order Entry → Inventory Check → Payment Processing.  
- **Banking**: Loan Application → Verification → Approval/Rejection.  

---

## 6. Best Practices
- Keep each agent’s role **focused on a single responsibility**.  
- Define **handoff conditions clearly** (when does one agent stop, and another begin?).  
- Implement **logging and monitoring** for every handoff step.  
- Design **fallback paths** (e.g., if verification fails, return to collection stage).  
- Maintain **modularity**, so new agents can be added without disrupting existing flows.  

---



## 8. When to Use
Deterministic Handoffs are ideal when:  
- Accuracy and reliability are more important than speed.  
- Workflows must follow strict compliance rules.  
- Processes cannot afford random mistakes (e.g., payments, healthcare, banking).  

---

## 9. Summary
Deterministic Handoffs provide a **reliable, traceable, and structured way of task delegation** in agent-based systems.  
They work best in **mission-critical workflows**, where consistency and correctness cannot be compromised.

### 2. Routing Agents
- **Definition**: Agents that decide where a request should go based on rules or content.  
- **Use Case**: Classifying incoming emails into support, sales, or technical queries.  
- **Ideas for Flow**:  
  - Input request → Router Agent → Forwarded to the correct specialized agent.  

---

### 3. LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Definition**: Using a language model to evaluate or score outputs from other agents.  
- **Use Case**: Comparing multiple answers and selecting the most accurate one.  
- **Ideas for Flow**:  
  - Multiple agents generate responses.  
  - Judge Agent evaluates results.  
  - Best response is selected and returned.  

---

### 4. Parallelization
- **Definition**: Running multiple agents or tasks simultaneously to save time.  
- **Use Case**: Research assistant collecting data from different sources at once.  
- **Ideas for Flow**:  
  - User request is split.  
  - Agents run in parallel.  
  - Results are merged and returned.  

---

### 5. Guardrails
- **Definition**: Safety mechanisms to prevent harmful, biased, or invalid outputs.  
- **Use Case**: Filtering sensitive or disallowed content before sending results to the user.  
- **Ideas for Flow**:  
  - Agent generates response.  
  - Guardrail layer checks for violations.  
  - Safe output is returned.
